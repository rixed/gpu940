* GPU940

Gpu940 is a soft 3D renderer that can do many rendering type, including true
perspective texture mapping. The software is designed to operate as a separate 
process. It's mainly targeted at GPH's GP2X (http://www.gp2x.com) but can be 
used on other platforms as well.

Commands are sent to the "GPU" using a cyclic buffer. On PC, this buffer is 
mmapped and shared by the "GPU" and the client.

The GPU performs clipping, projection and drawing.

Geometry can be drawn onto as many video buffers as you need (not limited to 
2). Textures and Z-buffers are like video buffers, so that any texture or 
z-buffer can be drawed onto, and that any previous video buffer can serve as a 
texture or z-buffer.
